# SGabelFinalProject

This final project is supposed to be a bot that would have been able
To farm enemies in Wizard101 and send the data to a website to display.

## Once downloaded, use the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## After that, to run the program, use:

```
python botmain.py
```

It does not do much, but if you are running Wizard101, it can detect some of the spells in your hand.
You can also write your drops into a dictionary, which will give you the frequency of the drops.
